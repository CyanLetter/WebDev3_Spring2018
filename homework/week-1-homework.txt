This week we're all going to make some changes to each others' repositories.

Part 1:

Take your final project from Web Dev 1 and create a git repository for it. You don't need to make any changes to the site just yet, but we will be using it later in this class.


Part 2:

Make a new project with the latest Circus Starter. Create a git repository with that project and do the following:

- Make sure your include a .gitignore file that lists 'node_modules'

- Commit the default circus starter project with the message 'initial commit'

- Delete the contents of README.md and replace it with '<your name> - Git Homework'

- Use markdown syntax to make your name bold in the readme. You will have to research how to do this.

- Delete the contents of the html file and replace it with basic markup that includes your name, your quarter, and a list of three people you would want to be woth during a zombie apocalypse.

- Commit this to the master (default) branch.


Next, demonstrate the use of branches

- Make a new branch called 'styling'

- Add some color and font settings to make your html page look a little nicer. Like you would want an 'about me' page on your portfolio to look.

- Commit your changes to the 'styling' branch

- Make a pull request to merge those changes back into the main branch

- Accept the pull request on github


Finally, demonstrate how to revert undesired changes. 

- Switch back to your master branch

- Add a line to your html file that includes your favorite color

- Commit that change and push

- Then, revert to the prevous commit, so your favorite color no longer appears

- Commit the reverted changes.

Post a link to your repository on ringmaster. I should be able to look through your commit history and see these exact steps carried out
