Refactor your final project from Web Dev 1. Based on everything you have learned in Web Dev 2 and 3, update this project to follow current web development standards and best practices. In the end, you should have a solid portfolio piece.

Refactoring includes the following tasks, in no particular order:

- Put your project in a Git repository.
- Update it to use the Circus Starter template
- Make sure it passes the starter template's validation
- Update your project to use Sass.
- Make it responsive.
- Make it pass accessibility validation with the WAVE tool.
- Make it follow good practices for SEO.
- Optimize page load times and pass Google's page speed tests.
- Add cool stuff, e.g. make the carousel work, add animations and transitions, replace placeholder content.
- Host it.

You will probably end up re-writing most of your site, and that's ok. When refactoring, deleting bad code is as important as adding good code. Use what you have learned to build this site better.
